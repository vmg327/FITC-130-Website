    <p>Hello, my name is Vanessa Gallic and I'm from Tseshaht First Nation. My mother is Diane Gallic and my father is Jason Gallic. My grandparents are the late James (Jim) Gallic and Jan (Jeanette) Gallic and the late Jack (John) Watts and Lillian Gus. I have two sisters Jennifer Gallic and Starla Watts and one brother Michael Gallic. I have one son Royston Good, one nephew Nikko Lamb and three nieces Tamara Watts, Jolene Mack and Taniesha Mack. I was a Licensed Practical Nurse for 10 years and decided that it was time for a career change. I researched many different programs and decided on the Professional Esthetics Program at VIU in Parksville, BC and graduated at the end of April 2020. With this career change I'm still helping people but just in a different way. I love to be creative and I've always wanted to start my own business.</p>

      <h2>Waxing</h2>
      <img src="images/Waxed Legs.jpg"
      alt="Photo of water and waxed legs"
      width="28%"
      height="28%"
      style="float: left; margin-right: 25px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/>
      <p>Avoid shaving 2-4 weeks before waxing because the hair needs to be 1/4 of an inch (length of a grain of rice) for optimal waxing results. Avoid excessive sun exposure 48 hours before your appointment. Please don't apply anything to the skin before waxing (e.g. deodorant, lotion, etc). Avoid exfoliating your skin 2 days before your appointment to avoid skin sensitivity. Book appointments 48 hours before special occasions in case of adverse reactions. Avoid makeup application for 2 hours after waxing. After waxing avoid excessively hot showers, baths, saunas or steam rooms for 24-48 hours. Don't suntan for 24 hours after the service. Wear loose clothing so your skin doesn't become irritated. Avoid exfoliating for 24 hours after the service. Don't swim in lakes or oceans after appointment because this can cause skin rashes and reactions. Furthermore, don't work out for 24 hours after because sweat can infect open follicles. Please don't apply any scented products on the waxed area for 24 hours.</p>
