  <p>Hello, my name is Vanessa Gallic and I'm from Tseshaht First Nation. My mother is Diane Gallic and my father is Jason Gallic. My grandparents are the late James (Jim) Gallic and Jan (Jeanette) Gallic and the late Jack (John) Watts and Lillian Gus. I have two sisters Jennifer Gallic and Starla Watts and one brother Michael Gallic. I have one son Royston Good, one nephew Nikko Lamb and three nieces Tamara Watts, Jolene Mack and Taniesha Mack. I was a Licensed Practical Nurse for 10 years and decided that it was time for a career change. I researched many different programs and decided on the Professional Esthetics Program at VIU in Parksville, BC and graduated at the end of April 2020. With this career change I'm still helping people but just in a different way. I love to be creative and I've always wanted to start my own business.</p>
